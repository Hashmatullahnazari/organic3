 <h1>
Simple Way To Start
Eating Healthier</h1>

<p>Keep healthy food readily available. When you get hungry, you’re more likely to eat the first thing you see on the counter or in the cupboard. Keep healthy food in easily accessible and visible places in your home and workplace.  Put some fruits in a basket and place it on the kitchen counter.</p>

</div>

Overall, given the strong effects that fruits can have on satiety, it seems beneficial to replace other foods, especially junk foods, with fruit to help you lose weight over the long term.

Making Sushi
Is An Art</h1>

<p>One highlight is the restaurant’s main sushi counter singularly carved from the trunk of a 220-year-old Japanese cypress or hinoki tree. Hinoki timber is highly revered in much of traditional Japanese architecture. At Shinji by Restaurant, it sets the stage for Master Chef and his team to demonstrate an artistry that dates back thousands of years.</p>
