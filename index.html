 <h1>
Simple Way To Start
Eating Healthier</h1>

<p>Keep healthy food readily available. When you get hungry, you’re more likely to eat the first thing you see on the counter or in the cupboard. Keep healthy food in easily accessible and visible places in your home and workplace.  Put some fruits in a basket and place it on the kitchen counter.</p>

Eating Fruit Can Help You Lose Weight</h1>
</div>

<div class="column">It’s often forgotten that fruits are incredibly filling. Because of their fiber and water contents and the extensive chewing involved in eating them, fruits are very satiating.

The satiety index is a measure of how much different foods contribute to feelings of fullness.</div>  
<div class="column">Not surprisingly, these men lost significant amounts of weight. Those who were overweight lost even more than those who were at a healthy weight.

Overall, given the strong effects that fruits can have on satiety, it seems beneficial to replace other foods, especially junk foods, with fruit to help you lose weight over the long term.
